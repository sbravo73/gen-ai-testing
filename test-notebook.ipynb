      "\n",
      "- **Overall Performance:** The total expenses were under budget by $85, primarily due to significant savings in Record 1.\n",
      "- **Main Contributors to Variance:**\n",
      "  - Record 1 showed the most significant savings due to both lower unit costs and fewer units.\n",
      "  - Record 4 and Record 5 caused the most overspending, primarily due to increased unit costs and higher unit volumes.\n",
      "- **Focus Areas:** \n",
      "  - Review the pricing strategy for Records 4 and 5 to control future costs.\n",
      "  - Investigate the reasons for the increased number of units in Records 4 and 5 to assess if these were necessary or if they can be optimized.\n",

      "\n",
      "1. **Total Variance**: The overall variance between the forecast and actual total expenses is **-$25** (or **-1.0%**), indicating that actual expenses were slightly lower than forecasted.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Significant Variances**:\n",
      "   - **Record ID 1**: The actual total cost was **$64**, which is **$36** lower than the forecast. This is primarily due to a lower unit cost and fewer units used.\n",
      "   - **Record ID 4**: The actual total cost was **$294**, which is **$94** higher than the forecast. This increase is attributed to a higher unit cost and more units used than anticipated.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Unit Cost Variances**:\n",
      "   - For **Record ID 1**, the unit cost was lower than forecasted, leading to savings.\n",
      "   - For **Record ID 2**, while the unit cost was higher than forecasted, the total cost variance was minimal due to a reduction in the number of units.\n",
      "   - **Record ID 4** saw both an increase in unit cost and number of units, resulting in the largest negative variance.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Percentage Variances**:\n",
      "   - The most significant percentage variance was for **Record ID 4** at **+47.0%**, indicating a substantial overspend in that category.\n",
      "   - The largest positive variance percentage was for **Record ID 1** at **-36.0%**, showing effective cost management.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "The overall travel and entertainment expenses were slightly below the forecast, primarily driven by savings in certain categories. However, significant overspending in others, particularly in Record ID 4, highlights areas that require closer monitoring and potential adjustments in future forecasts. Further analysis could be beneficial to understand the reasons behind the higher unit costs and increased usage in specific categories.\n"

      "### Conclusion\n",
      "Overall, the organization performed well against its budget, with a total variance of $23,589 under budget. The primary areas of concern are the slight overages in office costs and the significant under-expenditure in training/travel, which could indicate either an opportunity for future cost savings or a potential need for reassessment of training priorities. Further investigation into the reasons behind the overages in office costs may be warranted to ensure effective budget management moving forward.\n"
