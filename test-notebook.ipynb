      "   - The total actual cost is **$985 lower** than the forecasted amount, representing a **38.8% reduction** in expected expenses. This indicates a significant overall cost-saving.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Record Analysis:**\n",
      "   - **Record 1:** \n",
      "     - Actual costs were **$36 lower** than forecasted, primarily due to a lower unit cost and fewer units used. \n",
      "     - Variance: **-36%**.\n",
      "   - **Record 2:** \n",
      "     - Actual costs were **$60 lower** than forecasted, despite a higher unit cost. The reduction in the number of units contributed to the savings.\n",
      "     - Variance: **-3.75%**.\n",
      "   - **Record 3:** \n",
      "     - Actual costs were **$15 lower** than forecasted, attributed to a lower unit cost and a slightly higher number of units.\n",
      "     - Variance: **-6.25%**.\n",
      "   - **Record 4:** \n",
      "     - Actual costs exceeded the forecast by **$94**, primarily due to both a higher unit cost and an increased number of units used. \n",
      "     - Variance: **+47%**.\n",
      "   - **Record 5:** \n",
      "     - Actual costs were **$32 higher** than forecasted, due to a higher unit cost and an increased number of units.\n",

      "### Conclusion\n",
      "The analysis reveals that the majority of the travel and entertainment expenses came in under budget, resulting in a significant total savings. The key drivers of variance include reductions in unit costs and the number of units utilized in most records. However, Records 4 and 5 showed overspending, which should be investigated further to understand the reasons and mitigate future variances.\n"

      "#### Key Findings\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Total Variance**: The total forecasted cost was $2,640, while the actual cost was $2,255, resulting in a total negative variance of **-$385** or **-14.6%**.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Major Variances**:\n",
      "   - **Record ID 1**: There was a significant saving of **-$36** (36.0%) due to a lower unit cost and fewer units used.\n",
      "   - **Record ID 2**: The variance was minimal at **-$60** (3.75%), with a slight increase in unit cost but fewer units used than forecasted.\n",
      "   - **Record ID 3**: A negative variance of **-$15** (6.25%) was noted due to a decrease in unit cost but an increase in units consumed.\n",
      "   - **Record ID 4**: This record showed the largest positive variance of **+$94** (47.0%), attributed to an increase in both unit cost and units consumed, exceeding the forecast significantly.\n",
      "   - **Record ID 5**: A positive variance of **+$32** (8.0%) was observed, driven by a higher unit cost and an increase in units used.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Summary of Causes\n",
      "- **Cost Savings**: Records 1 and 2 showed lower unit costs and reduced consumption, contributing to overall savings.\n",
      "- **Increased Consumption**: Records 4 and 5 demonstrated higher costs and units consumed than expected, leading to overspending in those areas.\n",
      "- **Unit Cost Variability**: Fluctuations in unit costs across various records impacted the overall budget adherence.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Conclusion\n",
      "The overall analysis indicates that while there were savings in some areas, there were also significant overspending in others, particularly in Record IDs 4 and 5. Future forecasting should take into account the variability in both unit costs and consumption levels to enhance accuracy.\n"

      "### Conclusion\n",
      "The overall variance of $23,589.18 under budget is primarily driven by the substantial savings in training and travel expenses, while minor overspending in office costs (notably security) slightly offset the total savings.

      "- **Investigate Training Needs**: Assess if the reduced training and travel expenses indicate a need for strategic adjustments in employee development.\n",

      "- **Continuous Tracking**: Implement more frequent reviews of budget vs. actuals to identify variances early and adjust forecasts as necessary.\n"
